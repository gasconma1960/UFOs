# UFOs
JavaScript
## Background
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
## Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
Using JavaScript and HTML, you’ll modify the code in your index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter you created in this module, you’ll add filters for the city, state, country, and shape, as shown in the following image:

Using JavaScript, you’ll replace the `handleClick()` function in your `app.js` file with a new function that saves the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed. Then, you’ll create a new function to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria. The webpage will be updated with the search criteria after pressing "Enter".

Follow the instructions below and the numbered comments in the starter code to complete Deliverable 1.

1. Download the `ufo_starterCode.js`, rename it `app.js`, and place it in the js folder of your UFOs GitHub repository. The starter code includes the code used to populate the table from this module.
